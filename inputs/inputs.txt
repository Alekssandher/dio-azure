Hold up.. we getting season 2 this July? I thought it's gonna be 2026.. lol I didn't heard no leaks about this.
I didnt even know season 2 was annouced Let's go
The lofi and electro soundtracks were amazing previous season. The show doesn't need praise it's fucking amazing. The osts in this trailer seems to have similar feeling
I liked the first season a little, but I really like the opening music
W but I didn’t expect this anime to get another season
Finally getting into the meat of the story!
Awesome and season 1 music was too good and hope for season 2 will be same 👍👍🤞
LETS GOOO CANT WAIT TO WATCH
